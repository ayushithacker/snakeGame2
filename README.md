Build Snake game with javascript.
There are two snakes one is Father (Ninja) and second is Child (Spider). ‘Spider’ is baby
snake and whenever he wants something to eat, he asks his father to give him some
food. Ninja crawls and search for food in the jungle. Ninja loves food and is ‘foodie’ so
whenever he gets something, he eats the food along with his child ‘Spider’. As when
Ninja gets a food (touches yellow dot), size of Ninja should be increased as well as size of
Spider should be increased at the same time and everytime Ninja grabs the food,
position of the food will be changed randomly.
